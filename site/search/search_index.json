If the required topic already exists in the particular project the messages are directly published to that topic.If the required topic does not exist, a new topic is created according to the provided topic.id and project.id. Then the messages are published to the particular topic. Source googlepubsub (Source) A GooglePubSub Source receives events to be processed by Siddhi, from a topic in GooglePubSub Server.Here, a subscriber client creates a subscription to that topic and consumes messages from the subscription. Only messages published to the topic after the subscription is created are available to subscriber applications. The subscription connects the topic to a subscriber application that receives and processes messages published to the topic. A topic can have multiple subscriptions, but a given subscription belongs to a single topic.

With the following configurations the identified source, will subscribe to a topic having topic.id named as topicA which resides in a googlepubsub instance with the project.id of 'sp-path-1547649404768'. This GooglePubSub Source configuration listens to the events coming to a googlepubsub topic. The events are received in the text format and mapped to a Siddhi event, and sent to a the outputStream.","title":"API Docs - v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"},{"location":"api/latest/#api-docs-v100-snapshot","text":"","title":"API Docs - v1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"},{"location":"api/latest/#sink","text":"","title":"Sink"},{"location":"api/latest/#googlepubsub-sink","text":"GooglePubSub Sink publishes messages to a topic in GooglePubSub server.
